In this project, you'll find :

In the ControlPWM file, a program running on Arduino to control the 4 motors of a quadcopter drone with a remote that sends PWM signals. It allows the pilot to do the 4 elementary moves of a drone (yaw, pitch, roll, throttle)

In the ControlPPM file, a program also running on Arduino that does the same thing as ControlPWM but, this time, the remote sends PPM signals.

In the ControlPIC file, a program running on a PIC16f887 to control the 2 motors of a small car with a remote that sends PPM signals.
